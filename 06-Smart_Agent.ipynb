    "- **Notebook 03**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",

       "### Moving Indexes\n",
       "There is no native support for porting indexes in Azure AI Search. Search indexes are considered downstream data structures, accepting content from other data sources that collect operational data. As such, there's no built-in support for backing up and restoring indexes because the expectation is that you would rebuild an index from source data if you deleted it, or wanted to move it. However, if you want to move an index between search services, you can try using the index-backup-restore sample code in the Azure AI Search .NET sample repository. There's also a Python version of backup and restore available<sup><a href=\"https://blobstorage2znp775rdhyvo.blob.core.windows.net/techdocs/Azure_Cognitive_Search_Documentation_Overview.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2024-04-29T18:11:18Z&st=2024-03-17T10:11:18Z&spr=https&sig=qtSFdHgO4IxArZIDQZbvcc2T7Q4INFsy7XZiIjOqWE0%3D\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Backup and Restore\n",
       "There's no native support for backing up and restoring indexes in Azure AI Search. If you delete an Azure AI Search index or service, it can't be recovered. When you delete a search service, all indexes in the service are deleted permanently<sup><a href=\"https://blobstorage2znp775rdhyvo.blob.core.windows.net/techdocs/Azure_Cognitive_Search_Documentation_Overview.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2024-04-29T18:11:18Z&st=2024-03-17T10:11:18Z&spr=https&sig=qtSFdHgO4IxArZIDQZbvcc2T7Q4INFsy7XZiIjOqWE0%3D\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, while there are no native features for moving, backing up, or restoring indexes in Azure AI Search, you can explore the sample code provided in the Azure AI Search .NET sample repository for moving indexes between search services. However, it's important to note that once an index or service is deleted, it cannot be recovered, and all indexes in the service are permanently deleted.\n",
